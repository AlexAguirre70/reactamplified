# React App built with AWS Amplify

## Process
The app was built using the AWS CLI primarily with only changing basic code. <br>
I wanted to test the deployment and login process created with Amplify.<br>

## Technology
* AWS Amplify - to create, build, and deploy the app
* GraphQL API - to auto create the todo list
* AWS Authentication - to create the login process
* AWS UI React - to style the form
